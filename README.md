## üöÄ Key Features

- **Create/Delete Python Environments**  
  Easily create or remove isolated Python environments from any directory.
- **Powered by UV**  
  Utilizes [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for lightning-fast virtual environment operations.
- **Global Activation/Deactivation**  
  Activate or deactivate environments globally across your system.
- **Zero Bloat**  
  Minimal dependencies‚Äîno Anaconda overhead.
- **Auto-installs `uv` and `pip`**  
  Both tools are available in every new environment.
- **Cross-Platform**  
  Designed to work on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- **Centralized Environment Management**  
  Manage all your UV environments from a single location.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

```bash
# Install UVE
curl -L https://github.com/iamshreeram/uve/releases/latest/download/uve-install.sh | bash

# Usage Examples
uve create myenv 3.11           # Create a new environment with Python 3.11
uve activate myenv              # Activate the environment
uve deactivate                  # Deactivate the environment
```

---

## üí° Why UVE?

- **No Anaconda Bloat:** Pure, lightweight, and dependency-free.
- **Works Everywhere:** macOS, Linux, and Windows support.
- **Centralized Management:** Handle all your environments in one place.
- **Immediate User Benefit:** Replaces complex conda workflows with simple, fast commands.

---

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

### Minimal Changes, Maximum Benefit

1. **Leverages Existing UV Features:**  
   - Uses `uv venv --python` to set up base environments.
   - Manually copies installed packages (no new dependency resolution needed).

2. **Fits the Current Architecture:**  
   - Maintains the same environment layout as UV.
   - No database or heavy dependency changes required.

3. **Instant User Value:**  
   - Solves major pain points in the conda workflow.
   - More intuitive than manual environment recreation.

---

## üß™ Testing the Feature

```bash
# Create an environment
uve create myenv 3.11
uve activate myenv
uv pip install numpy pandas

# Verify installation
python -c "import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)"
```

---

## üå± Future Enhancements

- [ ] **Automated UV Installation:**  
      Auto-install and configure UV for every environment.
- [ ] **Universal Shell Support:**  
      Seamless integration across bash, sh, zsh, and fish.
- [ ] **Concurrent Environment Activation:**  
      Activate a new environment without deactivating the current one.
- [ ] **Clone/Copy Environments:**  
      Effortlessly duplicate existing environments.
